# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What is an instance variable in Ruby? How is it different from other variables?

  Your answer: An instance variable in Ruby is a variable that starts with @ and is scoped to a class where it's defined and any other inherited classes. Any objects that are created from that class can have different instances of that variable but they are different from other variables because they can only be accessed by the object.

  Researched answer: In the Ruby programming language, an instance variable is a type of variable which starts with an @ symbol. An instance variable is used as part of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to give objects their own private space to store data. https://www.rubyguides.com/2019/07/ruby-instance-variables/



2. What is a block in Ruby?

  Your answer: A block is a defined portion of code like a function that starts with a do or { and ends with an end or } and outputs the result of the function.

  Researched answer:
  A Ruby block is a way of grouping statements, and may appear only in the source adjacent to a method call; the block is written starting on the same line as the method call's last parameter (or the closing parenthesis of the parameter list) http://rubylearning.com/satishtalim/ruby_blocks.html


3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: An implicit return means that you do not need to do define what a function will return. Ruby automatically returns the last line in the function.

  Researched answer:
   A function that returned values without using the return keyword. Any statement in Ruby returns the value of the last evaluated expression https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/idiomatic-ruby-writing-beautiful-code-6845c830c664


4. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: Object-oriented programming is the concept of creating programs where every object belongs to a class with data and behavior. Function programming is the concept of using functions with behavior to create a program.

  Researched answer: Functional programming and object-oriented programming uses a different method for storing and manipulating the data. In functional programming, data cannot be stored in objects and it can only be transformed by creating functions. In object-oriented programming, data is stored in objects https://www.educba.com/functional-programming-vs-oop/



5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: A class is a blueprint for an object and is the intersection of data and behaviors. The object is an instance of the class.

  Researched answer:  A class is a template for objects. An object is a member or an "instance" of a class. An object has a state in which all of its properties have values that you either explicitly define or that are defined by default settings. https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Document/HLUs/User_Guide/classes/classoview.shtml
